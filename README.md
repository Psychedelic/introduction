# Introduction

Psychedelic is a decentralized venture studio focused on building products in the Internet Computer ecosystem. Weâ€™re a group of builders and creators working together to build & collaborate on projects, improvement proposals, standards, and Open Internet Services on the Internet Computer. The goal is to eventually become a fully community owned and operated DAO.

We want to create a collaboration-first community for:

- Discussing and proposing improvements and standards for the Internet Computer
- Help fund + launch projects and Open Internet Services that benefit the Internet Computer ecosystem
- Provide a space for like-minded community members  and projects to coordinate, collaborate, learn, and build the IC ecosystem together

Whether you are just starting out as a solo developer or have a running project already, Psychedelic is open to all. Feel free to reach out and join the community.
